## Explanation

So this is my project "el principito" 
here is the other repo: https://github.com/AliciaEA/el-principito
thats what I shipped to swirl

Also, this hackatime is halloween principito. 
El principito hackatime is in that repo

## Details

I know taht when you recharge the website the theme disappears. I really tried. But I couldnt fix it. I'm so sorry I hope y'all understands
I'm really proud of the pumpkin cursor

### Details website

1. Pumpkin cursor
2. :Hover Ghost Cursor
3. Secret website "Halloween" just when Halloween theme is active
4. A pumpkin on the secret website

### How it works?

Well, Im not that good with js, but what I did was just like a function to enable and disable the link to the stylesheet Halloween.css
It is not that efficient since the website just rewrites all the css from the original each time it reloads
I hope in v2, in my next website, I can make it better. Really happy to have participated in this ysws

### Extra

Even the 404 page is halloween themeddddd, check it outtttt
